# **MS-ChatBot-Buzz-Women - TEAM B4**

NLU powered chatbot, a one stop solution for business counselling of low-income women entrepreneurs.

## ❓ The Issue

सशक्त नारी सशक्त भारत - Strong women empowered India. Globally, only 1 in 5 businesses are owned by women. A study conducted by Buzz Women concluded that 25% of the women in their network (of 300,000) want to start a small business but they do not have a business idea. Low-income entrepreneurs lack the right tools, mentors, skills, and right business ideas based on their feasibility.

## ❓ The Solution

The answer to their needs is an AI-powered multilingual business counselling chatbot, integrated with telegram. Women residing in rural areas can talk to the bot in their local language(implemented for Kannada), and can ask about how to start a small business, enhance their skills, or grow an existing business. We have provided a click based user friendly UI with SWOT analysis.
